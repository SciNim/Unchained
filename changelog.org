* v0.1.9
- add =sqrt= for units that are a perfect square
- add =abs= for units  
- add ~+=~, ~*=~, ... where they make sense (e.g. only same units for
  ~+=~ and only with scalars for ~*=~
- add unary =-=
- add =hash= for units
- rename =toFloat= converters to a name less likely to conflict with
  other things (=toRawFloat=)
- replace basic SI unit generation by a macro call (=defineUnits=)
- change =getUnitTypeImpl= logic by using =typeKind=
* v0.1.8
- fix generation of SI prefixes if =exclude= is used. Previously
  mapping of short to long prefixes was broken if =exclude= was used.
- fix math of compound units that involved conversions SI prefixes and
  conversions to base units (i.e. Tesla to kg•s⁻²•A⁻¹) by adding a
  global SI prefix factor field to =CTCompoundUnit=
- reorder =ukDegree= in =UnitKind= enum 
* v0.1.7
- emit SI prefixed versions of Bq
* v0.1.6
- add Becquerel as a unit for activity
* v0.1.5
- fix issue #16, division of compound units works correctly now
- add Planck constant as =hp= and Boltzmann constant as =k=  
* v0.1.4
- fix issue #13, conversion of degrees and radians not possible with =to=

* v0.1.3
- fix ordering of internal compile time units
- make radian and steradian distinct meter based units to avoid
  conversion to a meter based representation when doing additive maths
  with them  

* v0.1.2
- fix ~==~ macro for same types of different names

* v0.1.1
- fix bug causing "Pound-force" parsing to fail

* v0.1.0
- support for all SI base units and most compound SI units
- *experimental* SI unit support for converting SI units to natural
  units according to HEP Lorentz-Heaviside convention
- add imperial units: =yard, foot, ounce, slug, lbf, acre=
